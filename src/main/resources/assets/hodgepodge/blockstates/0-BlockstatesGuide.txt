Name these files the same as it's corresponding REGISTRY name.

Ex: An block with a registry name of "BlockRuby" should have the file named "blockruby.json".

For each variant block state add a block model reference like so:
    "normal": { "model": "hodgepodge:rubyblock" }
Where "rubyblock" will be the name of the blick model json file.
