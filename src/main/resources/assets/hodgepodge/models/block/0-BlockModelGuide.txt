Name these files the same as you specified in the corresponding block's blockstates file.

Ex: A block with ""model": "hodgepodge:rubyblock"" specified as a model in it's blockstates
file should have a model file named "rubyblock.json".

When specifiying a texture with the following:

    "textures": {
        "all": "hodgepodge:blocks/rubyblock"
    }
    
The text "rubyblock" should be the name of the texture (png) file.
