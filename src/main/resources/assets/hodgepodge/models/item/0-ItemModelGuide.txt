For item models:
================================
Name these files the same as it's corresponding UNLOCALIZED name.
Ex: An item with an unlocalized name of "ruby" should have the file named "ruby.json".

When specifiying a texture with the following:

    "textures": {
        "layer0": "hodgepodge:items/ruby"
     }
    
The text "ruby" should be the name of the texture (png) file.

For itemblock models:
================================
Name these files the same as the block's corresponding UNLOCALIZED name.
Ex: A block with an unlocalized name of "rubyblock" should have the file named "rubyblock.json".

Tell the item model to be the same as the block model by adding this to the model file:
"parent": "hodgepodge:block/rubyblock"
